# cljs-kickoff

A Leiningen template for minimal ClojureScript project with lein-cljsbuild
and lein-ring.

It's intended to be as small as possible - only use Ring, ClojureScript,
lein-cljsbuild, and lein-ring. Users are free to add any other libraries as
they like.

It has complete configuration for lein-cljsbuild. The plugin compiles .cljs
files so that Ring can immediately serve them, it also is configured to
compile and include them in build.

## Included packages

```
:dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.5.1"]
               [org.clojure/clojurescript "0.0-2234"]
               [ring "1.3.0"]]
:plugins      [[lein-cljsbuild "1.0.3"]
               [lein-ring "0.8.11"]]
:hooks        [leiningen.cljsbuild]
```

## Usage

Create project:

```bash
lein new cljs-kickoff my-project
```

Up and running (with CLJS compilation):
```bash
cd my-project
lein ring server
```

Interactive developmnt:
```bash
# Shell 1 - start server:
cd my-project
lein ring server

# Shell 2 - cljsbuild will recompile cljs whenever the files change:
cd my-project
lein cljsbuild auto
```

Package and run from jar:
```bash
cd my-project
lein ring uberjar
java -jar target/my-project-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```

## More resources

This project is intentionally minimal. There's plenty resources on ClojureScript
on the web. Feel free to take a look at the posts on my blog at
